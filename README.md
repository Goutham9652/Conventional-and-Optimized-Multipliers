# Conventional-and-Optimized-Multipliers

* This Repo Contains the Multipliers using Conventional Methods and also Modified(optimized) using Kogge-Stone Adder in order to Reduce the Delay
* Please refer the *https://github.com/Goutham9652/Kogge-Stone_Adders_with_all_configurations* that have been used in current multipliers.
* Half and Full adders are replaced by the Kogge-Stone adder.

The following image shows the approch to the proposed Array multiplier:

- Note that I have used only One Testbench for all the Designs since all are 8-bit multipliers and no difference in inputs or outputs instead performance.
- And keep in mind that the clock have been used in order to remove the synthesis failure, `Clk` is never used in any combinational circuits.
- Feel free to ask if any queries.
