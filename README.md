# Conventional-and-Optimized-Multipliers

* This Repo Contains the Multipliers using Conventional Methods and also Modified(optimized) using Kogge-Stone Adder in order to Reduce the Delay
* Please refer the *https://github.com/Goutham9652/Kogge-Stone_Adders_with_all_configurations* that have been used in current multipliers.
* Half and Full adders are replaced by the Kogge-Stone adder.

The following image shows the approch to the proposed Array multiplier:
